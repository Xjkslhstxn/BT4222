Its current role in health and healthcare includes improving symptom management, providing patient-centered care, and promoting overall well-being. Aromatherapy can be used in conjunction with traditional medical treatments to enhance their effectiveness.

The potential role of aromatherapy in health and healthcare is vast, with ongoing research exploring its benefits in various conditions such as pain management, anxiety reduction, nausea relief, and fatigue management. Evidence-based practice is essential in determining the efficacy of aromatherapy in these areas.

Safety and ethical issues are important considerations when using aromatherapy in healthcare settings. It is crucial to ensure the quality and purity of essential oils, as well as to consider any potential interactions with medications or existing medical conditions. Practitioners must also adhere to ethical guidelines in their practice, respecting patient autonomy and informed consent.

In practice situations, healthcare providers must assess the individual needs of patients, administer essential oils appropriately, and evaluate their effectiveness in managing symptoms. This may involve using different delivery methods such as inhalation, topical application, or massage.

Establishing and sustaining a clinical aromatherapy program requires careful planning and coordination. This includes developing protocols for the use of essential oils, training healthcare staff in aromatherapy techniques, and ensuring ongoing evaluation of the program's effectiveness.
