Data can be stored and processed in two main ways: batch processing, where data is collected and processed in large chunks at scheduled intervals, and streaming data, where data is processed in real-time as it is generated.

Relational data refers to data that is structured in tables with defined relationships between them, while non-relational data does not adhere to a strict tabular structure and can be more flexible in terms of data storage.

In the context of Microsoft Azure and data management, understanding core data concepts and roles is essential for effectively storing, managing, and analyzing data.",Explore Core Data Concepts in Microsoft Azure
