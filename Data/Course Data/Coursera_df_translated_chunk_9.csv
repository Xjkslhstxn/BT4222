Resistivity is a material property that describes how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current and is measured in ohm-meters (Ωm). Sheet resistance is the resistance of a thin sheet of material and is measured in ohms per square (Ω/sq).

To perform four-point probe current-voltage measurements, four probes are placed on the surface of the material in a square configuration. A known current is passed through the outer probes, and the voltage drop is measured across the inner probes to calculate the resistance of the material.

The transfer length method is a technique used to measure the resistance of a semiconductor device by analyzing the voltage drop along the length of the device. This method can provide information about the quality of the contacts and the overall resistance of the device.

This course covers topics related to semiconductor devices, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, semiconductor characterization techniques, semiconductor materials, and semiconductor device physics. Week 2.1 focuses on resistivity and sheet resistance, Week 2.2 covers resistance measurements and four-point probes, Week 2.3 discusses measuring contact resistance, Week 2.4 explores the current-voltage characteristics of diodes, and Week 2.5 concludes with a course wrap-up and project in physical science and engineering.",Electrical Characterization: Diodes
